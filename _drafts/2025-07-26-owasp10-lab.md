The [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) is a list of 10
critical web application security risks and serves as a standard for web
developers and security professionals looking to mitigate any application
security vulnerabilities.

In this lab, I will demonstrate the top 5 security risks and how to mitigate
them. These examples will be pretty bare bones, seeking to show as little as
possible aside from the actual risk. This is to both make the concept on
display clearer and keep the code minimal.

The web app code for each risk can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/josephdepalo/owasp10lab).

## 1. Broken Access Control & 2. Cryptographic Failures

### Definitions

**Broken Access Control** refers to when a user can act outside of their
permissions. A normal user being able to access an admin's dashboard would be
an example of this, and this is what we will walk through below.

**Cryptographic Failures** refers to any instance where sensitive data is
missing encryption or weak encryption is used. This also pertains to data that
the end user shouldn't be able to modify being unsigned or using a weak
signature algorithm/key. One example of a cryptographic failure is storing
passwords using an insecure algorithm like SHA-256 and no
[salt](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techtips/what-is-password-salting/).

### Walkthrough

![Login Page]()

First, we will register a user. I'll use the username `user1` and password
`password`. Once our user is created, let's login.

![user1 Dashboard]()

If we take a look at the URL, logging into the website brought us to our
user's dashboard at `/dashboard/2`. It the `/dashboard` part makes sense, but
what is the `/2` referring to? A reasonable guess is some kind of user ID. If
that's the case, then changing this should allow us to see the dashboards of
other users if there aren't controls in place to prevent that.

Let's try accessing `/dashboard/1`.

![Unauthorized Page]()

It seems that we aren't authorized to view this page, but now we know that it
exists. Now let's take a look at how this web app is actually tracking our
identity. If we inspect the page and take a look at our cookies, we see only
an `access_token` value.

![Site Cookies]()

The contents of `access_token` look like a **JSON web token (JWT)**. JWTs are
a common token format typically used for stateless authentication to in modern
web apps and APIs. They consist of 3 blocks of base64 encoded text separated
by dots in the form `<Header>.<Payload>.<Signature>`.

We can take a closer look at our JWT using online tools. Copy the token and go
to [jwt.io](https://www.jwt.io/). Here, paste the token into the decoder.

![Decoded JWT]()

There are two important things to note about this JWT:

- In the header, `alg` is set to `none` and there is no signature. This means
  we can change the payload to whatever we want.
- The payload contains an `id` field that is set to `2`, the same value we saw
  in the URL for our dashboard. This confirms our suspicions that the value
  after `/dashboard` is an ID.

Since we have the freedom to do whatever we want with this JWT, let's try
changing the payload `id` to `1` (switch to the *JWT Encoder* tab of
[jwt.io](https://www.jwt.io/) and edit the `id` value). Return to the web app
and replace the old JWT with the new one.

Now when we access `/dashboard/1`, we're in!

![Admin Dashboard]()

## 3. Injection (and more bad cryptography)
