My name is Joseph DePalo, and I'm a senior at [Stevens Institute of
Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer
Science. I'm also a Security Engineer intern at [IEX](https://www.iex.io/).

In my free time I like to read, lift weights, play video games, and spend time
with my dogs.
