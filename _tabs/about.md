# Hey, I'm Joe! ðŸ‘‹

Currently I'm a fourth-year student at [Stevens Institute of
Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) studying computer science and
concentrating in cybersecurity. I'm an aspiring security professional who
has gotten hands-on experience with several internships under my belt. In
my experience I've found that I'm at my best when I'm applying my skills to
security/IT problems in creative ways and streamlining InfoSec operations,
whether that means deploying new tools or writing some scripts for automation.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building out my home lab.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to deploy IAM/SSO tools on my home lab

or message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-depalo/)

In my free time I like to read, lift weights, play video games, and spend time
with my dogs.
